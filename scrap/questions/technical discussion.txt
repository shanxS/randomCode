1. Find the first k largest numbers from large file size. Explain solution for
       a. When we have space to store K elements in RAM
       b. When we didn’t have space to store K elements in RAM
2. Given a n-ary tree of resources arranged hierarchically. A process needs to lock a resource node in order to use it. But,
    ? A node cannot be locked if any of its descendant or ancestor is locked.
    I was supposed to
    -> write the structure of node
    -> write codes for
    -> islock()- returns true if a given node is locked and false if it is not
    -> lock()- locks the given node if possible and updates lock information
    -> unlock()- unlocks the node and updates information.

    Codes should be :
    Islock –O(1)
    Lock()- O(log n)
    unLock()- O(log n)
    
    HINT: use B+ tree
3. Print the anagrams present in a huge file (each line in file contains one word and you didn’t have any constraints like  
   limited memory etc..) for a give string

   use trie or hashmap
4. Design a tree, in which a root can have unlimited children and write a code to print each level in separate level   
5. Design T9 dictionary
6. Print the anagrams present in a huge file
7. how will you save a binary tree in a file - no assumption on binary tree
8.  First I was asked to design a Data structure with O(1) insertion and O(1) search. I told about hashing. Then he told me to get a random number from the current list of numbers which have been inserted into my Ds. So I maintained an array storing pointers to the hash table.(Assume no Collision, he told so).Then he said O(1) deletion also. I was stuck on this I was not able to make both deletion and getRandom in O(1).After Some Discussion he moved on.
9. A robot problem: No. of ways to reach from 0,0 to m,n in a m*n grid. I had to tell recursive function only. No code required.
10. design pattern and OOPS
