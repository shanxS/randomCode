6. Find maximum product of subarray in given array of integers
7. A function printMostFrequentWords, which takes in an array of strings, was given. It is required to print a list of all the 
   letters that occurred with the highest frequency in each line of the array, followed by the frequency.
   The list of letters should be an alphabetical list of upper case letters followed by an alphabetical list of lower case 
   letters.

12. Spiral or zigzag level order traversal of a tree.
13. A person can jump 1 or 2 steps. No of ways of reaching the top of n stairs. (Try for O(1) space.)
14. Find the longest substring in a string with exactly 2 unique characters. The substring should not contain more than two 
    different chars. in O(n)
    So, aaaaabbaaa is a valid substring
    Also, ccaccccaccaca is a valid substring.
15. vertical sum of binary tree
16. print tree vertically
17. In a binary tree, a complete path is defined as a path from root to a leaf. The sum of all nodes on that path is defined as the sum of that path. Given a number K, we have to remove (prune the tree) nodes from the tree which lie on a path having sum less than K.
18. Given a binary tree, find the number of pairs where sum of 2 nodes’ values equal to k
19. reverse k nodes at a time in linked list
20. merge k sorted arrays
21. reconstruct binary tree from inorder and preorder traversal
22. Least common ancestor of a binary tree and BST
23. duplicate binary tree with mad pointer
24. duplicate linked list with mad pointer
25. minimum insertions needed to convert string to palindrome
26. gold coin problem: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-31-optimal-strategy-for-a-game/
27. print boundary and leaf nodes of binary tree
28. counting sort
29. adding of numbers respresented as linked list
30. multiplying numbers represented as linked list
31.  Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array. So 3 2 7 10 should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10) or 3 2 5 10 7 should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).
I was able to give him a DP solution with a Parent array which stores thee index of the parent of every element,i hd put -1 for the first element,at the end I backtrack the array to find the all the elements.
32. partial tree implementation for doing range queries (range sum, range max, min etc)
33. longest sinusoidal sequence in array OR  Find longest subsequence that is zig zag OR https://www.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=1259&rd=4493 In O(n) time

35. max length of continuous sub array with at max 3 unique elements
36. max rectangular area of histogram - using stack VS using partial tree
37. kth largest element in array
38. k largest(or smallest) elements in an array - can be done as 37 was done
39. topological sort
40. test if array is majority array
41. array find all the triplets which satisfy the triangle property
42. test if binary tree is height balanced
43. test if given tree is subtree if of another given tree
44. print levels of tree in bottom up manner
45. Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words. http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-32-word-break-problem/
46. line sweep - We are given an array of n points in the plane, and the problem is to find out the closest pair of points in the array.

57. Given an undirected graph and a number m, determine if the graph can be colored with at most m colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with same color. Here coloring of a graph means assignment of colors to all vertices. 
58. Hamiltonian Path in an undirected graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian Path such that there is an edge (in graph) from the last vertex to the first vertex of the Hamiltonian Path. Determine whether a given graph contains Hamiltonian Cycle or not. If it contains, then print the path
