1. Discussed on my current roles and responsibilities
we are a small team so everyone has to do everything - from fixing bugs to writing features to writing system tests

2. why do you want to join to Amazon?
I would like to make a positive impact on millions of people - what better way to do it than working for most customer centric company in the world?

3. What are your accomplishments in your role so far?
apart form regular things - I proud of hackathon win, android app, KATS upgrade


4. What are the things that you’re not good at and need to improve?
Time management, I feel is a problem for me - I dont take time out of work - I dont have work life balance - all my waking hours are spent in front of a computer

5. Challenging situation faced
2 times - both instanes was race against time - 
    - hackathon: everyone was runnig against time - I took up the task which I knew how to do but had very little exposure with tools (JS/browser) - since everyone was runnig against time - I had to do it anyway
    - android app: was a side project - another race against time - java based android app was a flop becasue soap clients are not available for android - had to switch to Xamarin and do it in C# - we wanted to show it to our CEO - this app finally ended up in project roadmap

4. Why should we hire you?
AFAIK amazon is looking for people who are smart, self motivated and willing to go that extra mile to get the things done - I believe I belong to that category

5. when did you feel that something could have been done in better way after delivering it in project
Almost all the time :) when I do a feature and 2 or 3 weeks later I come back to same code - my understanding of the system and use cases has improved and I this makes me realize that probaly a better way was possible

6. when did you perform best way, as in what did you come up with that other could not do
I belive my strongest point is maintaing focus and consistency in face for adversity - particulary when things are time bound - thats where I excel - andriod app, KATS adaption

7. when did you go out of the way i.e. against your managers, or higher authority and deliver the best according to you
as far as product is concerned, that has never happend so far - if I feel my solution is beeter than what my seniors suggests - we debate - a lot - and then irrespective of the fact where idea orignated from the best idea is implemented
