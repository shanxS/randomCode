1. break your goals to sub goals and sub goals to daily achievable targets
2. be productive - immediate results shold be visible - daily targets - maintain a log of what you screwed up and what you did beyond expectation - every single day
3. introspect on weekly basis - your previous week's results - direction and progress with the current project - things like, 
	- do we need help, what kind of help
	- how can we measure progress on universe scale (compare with your competition)



Notes:
1. focus is not option - its necessary
2. hardwork and lonliness are part of process - deal with it
3. you are destined for great things - this is a fact
