1. operator precedence for postfix to infix
2. aysmtotic analysis on top coder, NP, P, NP complete and NP hard from geeks for geeks
3. sum of AP and GP
4. LIS
5. KMP
6. multiply 2 numbers represnetd as linked list
7. definition of pre and post order traversal
8. public int hashCode()
    {
        int result = 17;
        result = 31 * result + r;
        result = 31 * result + c;
        return result;
    }
9. min of 3: Math.min(a, Math.min(b, c)) 
10. complete, perfect and full binary tree
11. in array or seq. swapping N with 0, N-1 with 1, N-2 with 2 and so on. Essentially reverses the seq :)
12. if you are dividing range 0 to N by halves - you have infinite loop for 0 to 1 - to check for it test if range has lenght 1 or more than 1
13. for any binary tree inorder + (post or pre or level) order can uniquly identify it. BUT for strict or perfect (not complete) binary tree - only inoder and preorder are enough
